  # I will note here that 2d-average-no-slip.i run with the cli arg: velocity_interp_method='rc' (e.g. an RC run) demonstrates a very obnoxious phenomenon along the axis of symmetry where the radial velocity is negative (it should be zero). The effect of this phenomenon decreases with refinement, but still annoys me greatly. I have been unable to figure out why this happens. Kudos to whoever can solve this issue!
